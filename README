THIS IS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A LATTICE BOLTZMANN ALGORITHM FOR A TWO COMPONENT FLUID
IN WHICH THE TWO COMPONENTS ARE COUPLED THROUGH A FORCING COEFFICIENT. CURRENTLY, 
THERE ARE TWO INITIALIZATION ROUTINES. 

1) SINUSOIDAL DENSITY PROFILES
2) CONSTANT VELOCITIES: MAKING THE VELOCITY AS A FUNCTION OF TIME ONLY.

YOU CAN ALSO CALCULATE THEORETICAL VALUES FROM DECLARED INITIAL CONDITIONS. AT THE 
MOMENT, YOU CAN CALCULATE THEORETICAL VALUES OF

1) CONTINUOUS ANALYTIC SOLUTION
2) DISCRETE ANALYTIC SOLUTION
3) FINITE DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATION

IN ORDER TO ACCESS THESE, UNCOMMENT EACH FILE AND RECOMPILE
